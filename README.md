*whispers are always appreciated, but i'm pretty socially inept and might not know how to carry a conversation, making it end short.* (it's NOTHING personal!)

*anybody is free to sit/cuddle with me! just don't hide behind me its p awkward*

*if i'm with a group of friends, please don't suddenly walk up and sit next to me.*

*just because im in a skin of a media doesn't mean im in the fandom! i might not like engaging with you.*

*if you know me from previous friendgroups, oh my god dont come up to me.*

*i only roleplay on party island!*

# "STARE AT MY SCREEN -"

(🍃) **DISCLAIMER REGARDING MY SKINS, READ THIS TOO**

*i do not support any problematic creators regardless if i have skins of their characters. this goes for my karl jacobs & sapnap skin(s) & any other dsmp skin i may make in the future. unfortunately i have fallen to the 2020 relapse propaganda. if you have a problem with me having dsmp skins, just don't interact please!!*

*ALL OF MY SKINS HAVE MY GITHUB LINKED. if you see a copy without this github it is NOOTTTT me!*
